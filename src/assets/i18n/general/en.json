  "_q_new_system_":  "Why is there a new ranking system?",
  "_a_new system_":  " We found that the head to head system did not encourage enough competitive play.  The new system awards points for progress in a tournament without ever penalizing a player for a poor result.  Players can build their rankings quickly by playing more and performing well.",
  "_q_my_ranking_":  " Why did my ranking go down (or up)?",
  "_a_my_ranking_":  "If you did not play many events last year, you will likely find that your ranking dropped, perhaps significantly.  The head to head system did not require you to play many matches to maintain a ranking.  In the new system, as in the professional rankings, if you do not play, you will not be able to maintain a ranking.  By playing a few tournaments, you will soon be able to build your ranking to reflect your quality as a player.",
  "_q_my_initial_ranking_":  " How did you calculate my initial ranking?",
  "_a_my_initial_ranking_":  " We loaded the system with your results from sanctioned tournament play in 2013. While we were able to load almost all tournaments from 2013, some small number could not be imported.  Your initial ranking for 2014 was calculated exactly as it will be calculated in 2014. Points are awarded based on a combination of factors:  how far you progress; the age group of the event; the level of the event. The web site below provides lots of detail about this. ",
  "_q_many_rankings_":  "Why are there so many different rankings?",
  "_a_many_rankings_":  "We are introducing rankings for Adult play in skill level tournaments, Senior rankings in every age category, doubles rankings provincial rankings in every category.  Each group has different play patterns and competitive structures in place and the rankings are adapted to each.  This website has a very careful description of how Open, Junior, Adult and Senior rankings are built.",
  "_q_ranking_and_seeding_":  " Will the new rankings will be used to seed tournaments?",
  "_a_ranking_and_seeding_":  "Many provincial tennis associations will be using the rankings to seed tournaments as of Jan 13, 2014 but others are rolling out on a different timeline. Please contact your provincial tennis association for further information.",
  "_adult_rankings_notice_":  "The scope of the Adult Rankings is primarily provincial and the system is new in many provinces. As there is as yet no national standard for 5.0, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 3.0 and 2.5 tournaments and no national tournament structure for these levels, the national rankings are not considered “official”.",
  "_open_rankings_notice_":  "The Open Rankings are available provincially and nationally as of Feb 14, 2014. The rankings methodology will be continually under review for improvement.

  "_Choice_of_60_Percent_":  "Single Elimination - Why 60%",
  "_C60P_Detail_":  "The value 60% was chosen as it has a good balance between properly rewarding a player’s accomplishment and not over-weighting the top finisher's points. This approach is consistent with international ranking methods used by the ATP, WTA, and  ITF.",
  "_SE_Consolations_":  "Single Elimination Consolations",
  "_SE_Consolations_Detail_":  "Consolation draws refine a player's final position in a draw.  For example, a full feed-in consolation can determine 5th and 6th place finishers.  The system awards points accordingly as can be seen in the point awards tables.  ",
  "_Other_Draw_Types_":  "Other Draw Types",
  "_Other_Draw_Types_Detail_":  "Some tournament structures (like box and draw, compass, or round robin) allow for still more exact calculation of finish position.  For instance Canadian U14 National Championships will have finishers in 9th, 10th, 17th, 18th, 25th, 26th, 33rd and 34th as well as many more tied positions like a 27-28 tie. The ranking system calculates points for all of these finishing positions in all types of draws. ",
  "_View_Other_Point_Awards_":  "Viewing Point Awards for Other Finishing Positions",
  "_View_Other_Point_Awards_Detail_":  "The points table provides point awards for many finishing positions, but there is not enough room to publish awards for every possible finishing position. If you would like to see the point awards for a particular finishing position that is not shown directly on the points table, simply adjust the “custom finish position” value.",
  "_DPC_Formula_":  "Point Calculation Formula",
  "_DPC_Formula_Detail_":  "For the curious, the following equation shows how the ranking system calculates the number of points “p” received for a given finish position “fp” in a draw in which the winner receives winner points “wp”. The .6 in the formula represents the fact that each round gets 60% of the previous round in a straight elimination draw. This formula works correctly for any finish position and not just for elimination draws. ",

Players receive a ranking by playing at least one of the specified ranking events. ",
