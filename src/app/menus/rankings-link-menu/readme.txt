The RankingsLinkMenu

This produces a menu for each rankings group: Junior, Open, Adult, Masters and Wheelchair.

The menu starts with a links to the "About" page which describes the gory details for rankings
rules for that rankings group.

The menu is tabular because some groups have a lot of links. The Masters menu, for example has 52 links for
national rankings categories and if the user is focused on a province, there are 52 more for provincial rankings.

The code relies on the RankingsGroup class which lists all the categories in a given rankings group.
